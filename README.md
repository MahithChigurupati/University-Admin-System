Requirements: 
1.	All classes should create CRUD functions.
2.	Write Search features. Search by: 
A.	Program Name
B.	Course Name
C.	College Name
D.	Course Category Name
3.	Metrics
•	All fields should have values
•	Fields with the same color should be linked to each other
•	Error handling should be implemented. Eg: If you try to delete a college or program which is not empty, program should return a notification but no error or interruption
4.	No UI is needed, this should be a Menu driven program like Assignment 4 (Make sure you have a Back button to navigate through the Menu)

## Milestone 2
This assignment will consist of enhancing the application that you worked on in assignment #5 by adding a User Interface programmatically as follows:

- The application should be an iOS application that has at least one view.(Use the EmptyApp zip file attached on canvas)
- Add a text field for each of the parameters that need to be entered by the user.
- Add buttons to the view – One for each command (Add, Update, View, Delete)
- For the list command, add a new view with a text area (UITextView) to display the list of items instead of using the console.
- The views for the search results and list results should have a close button to bring you back to the main view.
- Add alerts and success popups whenever applicable. (On creation, on errors etc.)
- Do not use ViewControllers or IB to build your interface. Use code as described in the class.
